## Power BI Project Overview :

I'm thrilled to share my recent Power BI project with you all, focusing on AtliQ Hardware, an imaginary company specializing in hardware like PCs, mice, and other electronic goods. Their business model is similar to HP or Dell, where they manufacture hardware and sell it to stores, which then sell these products to consumers.

## Problem Statement :

AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing electronic goods company, faced substantial losses in the Latin American market due to decisions based on gut feelings rather than solid data. In response, they prioritized integrating data analytics to enable informed, data-driven decisions, moving beyond their reliance on Excel.
